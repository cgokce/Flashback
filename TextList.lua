    [1] = "Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.",
    [2] = "Success is not final, failure is not fatal: it is the courage to continue that counts.",
    [3] = "In war there is no prize for the runner-up.",
    [4] = "Ours is a world of nuclear giants and ethical infants. We know more about war than we know about peace, more about killing than we know about living.",
    [5] = "The soldier above all others prays for peace, for it is the soldier who must suffer and bear the deepest wounds and scars of war.",
    [6] = "They died hard, those savage men - like wounded wolves at bay. They were filthy, and they were lousy, and they stunk. And I loved them.",
    [7] = "We must be prepared to make heroic sacrifices for the cause of peace that we make ungrudgingly for the cause of war. There is no task that is more important or closer to my heart.",
    [8] = "War is an ugly thing, but not the ugliest of things. The decayed and degraded state of moral and patriotic feeling which thinks that nothing is worth war is much worse.",
    [9] = "Future years will never know the seething hell and the black infernal background, the countless minor scenes and interiors of the secession war; and it is best they should not. The real war will never get in the books.",
    [10] = "There's no honorable way to kill, no gentle way to destroy. There is nothing good in war. Except its ending.",
    [11] = "The death of one man is a tragedy. The death of millions is a statistic.",
    [12] = "Death solves all problems - no man, no problem.",
    [13] = "In the Soviet army it takes more courage to retreat than advance.",

    [15] = "Never think that war, no matter how necessary, nor how justified, is not a crime.",
    [16] = "Every man's life ends the same way. It is only the details of how he lived and how he died that distinguish one man from another.",
    [17] = "All wars are civil wars, because all men are brothers.",
    [18] = "I have never advocated war except as a means of peace.",
    [19] = "Older men declare war. But it is the youth that must fight and die.",
    [20] = "Only the dead have seen the end of war.",
    [21] = "Death is nothing, but to live defeated and inglorious is to die daily.",
    [22] = "It is well that war is so terrible, or we should get too fond of it.",
    [23] = "A soldier will fight long and hard for a bit of colored ribbon.",
    [24] = "He who fears being conquered is sure of defeat.",
    [25] = "You must not fight too often with one enemy, or you will teach him all your art of war.",
    [26] = "If we don't end war, war will end us.",
    [27] = "From my rotting body, flowers shall grow and I am in them and that is eternity.",
    [28] = "He who has a thousand friends has not a friend to spare, And he who has one enemy will meet him everywhere.",
    [29] = "For the Angel of Death spread his wings on the blast, And breathed in the face of the foe as he pass'd; And the eyes of the sleepers wax'd deadly and chill, And their hearts but once heaved, and for ever grew still!",
    [30] = "They wrote in the old days that it is sweet and fitting to die for one's country. But in modern war, there is nothing sweet nor fitting in your dying. You will die like a dog for no good reason.",
    [31] = "There is many a boy here today who looks on war as all glory, but, boys, it is all hell. You can bear this warning voice to generations yet to come. I look upon war with horror.",
    [32] = "War is as much a punishment to the punisher as it is to the sufferer.",
    [33] = "War would end if the dead could return.",
    [34] = "When you have to kill a man it costs nothing to be polite.",
    [35] = "Battles are won by slaughter and maneuver. The greater the general, the more he contributes in maneuver, the less he demands in slaughter.",
    [36] = "History will be kind to me for I intend to write it.",
    [37] = "We shall defend our island, whatever the cost may be, we shall fight on the beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds, we shall fight in the fields and in the streets, we shall fight in the hills; we shall never surrender.",
    [38] = "When you get to the end of your rope, tie a knot and hang on.",
    [39] = "A hero is no braver than an ordinary man, but he is brave five minutes longer.",
    [40] = "Our greatest glory is not in never failing, but in rising up every time we fail.",
    [41] = "The characteristic of a genuine heroism is its persistency. All men have wandering impulses, fits and starts of generosity. But when you have resolved to be great, abide by yourself, and do not weakly try to reconcile yourself with the world. The heroic cannot be the common, nor the common the heroic.",
    [42] = "If the opposition disarms, well and good. If it refuses to disarm, we shall disarm it ourselves.",
    [43] = "The object of war is not to die for your country but to make the other bastard die for his.",
    [44] = "Better to fight for something than live for nothing.",

    [47] = "Cowards die many times before their deaths; The valiant never taste of death but once.",
    [48] = "Never interrupt your enemy when he is making a mistake.",
    [49] = "There are only two forces in the world, the sword and the spirit. In the long run the sword will always be conquered by the spirit.",
    [50] = "There will one day spring from the brain of science a machine or force so fearful in its potentialities, so absolutely terrifying, that even man, the fighter, who will dare torture and death in order to inflict torture and death, will be appalled, and so abandon war forever.",
    [51] = "Live as brave men; and if fortune is adverse, front its blows with brave hearts.",
    [52] = "Courage and perseverance have a magical talisman, before which difficulties disappear and obstacles vanish into air.",
    [53] = "Courage is being scared to death - but saddling up anyway.",
    [54] = "Above all things, never be afraid. The enemy who forces you to retreat is himself afraid of you at that very moment.",
    [55] = "I have never made but one prayer to God, a very short one: 'O Lord, make my enemies ridiculous.' And God granted it.",
