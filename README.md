# Flashback

Ever miss those glorious moments from the games like Call of Duty or Battlefield? Say no more. This addon provides the nostalgia you need, by showing you carefully selected quotes in a death state until you revive. We can not prevent death... but might as well enjoy it.

## Updates
ESOUI upload will be coming soon, possibly after implementing a few more features. Do you have any requests? Check the roadmap below and feel free to create an issue if it does not exists. 

PR's are also welcome, just let me know via an issue beforehand if you want to contribute. I want to keep the addon simple to do not have any burden on the performance.

## Roadmap
- PVP Scene Recap toggle and repositioning
- Menu for the text size and color
- Add more quotes to select from
